            <p>Please note, this is just plain old HTML as the idea of this website is that as the page numbers
                increase, so does the complexity, so it develops along with my learning.
            </p>
            <p>It's janky, nothing looks nice, and the Times New Roman may make you sick.</p>
            <p>It's not all I can do though. I'm now 4 weeks and a handful of days into a bootcamp course to help me
                enter the world of software development. Having not done any sort of coding before, it's been a fairly
                steep learning curve, though I'm getting to grips with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and a few other
                technologies. Next week we're starting on JavaScript.</p>
            <p>In case you can't tell, this page is a create and forget thing. It's a moment in time and should be seen
                as such. I'll look back on this in a couple of weeks and cringe.</p>

                <h2>The Code Institute</h2>
                <p>This seems like a good place to start. I started a 16-week bootcamp on October 21st, and today being
                    a month later exactly it's a great time to review where I am at. I've been using the Code Institute
                    LMS and working through modules to learn how to create websites. We started off with HTML like this
                    page and have gradually increased the sophistication to the point where this soon into the course I
                    feel pretty confident making nice looking websites.</p>
                <p>I'd recommend the course to anyone looking to move into coding, though it's full time and you need to
                    be very self-reliant. All of the CI staff are great though - very supportive and knowledgeable.</p>
                <p>Links to their website and the course are below (apologies if they go out of date - I don't know how
                    long the course's page will be active)...</p>
