            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>CSS, or cascading style sheets, is (or are?) used to add some styling finesse to basic HTML pages. That
                first page was pretty dire, and probably triggering if you were alive in the 90s when most sites looked
                like that, and this page should hopefully look a little better. There are people who really excel in
                making pages look amazing with CSS, though I'm not one of them yet. By this stage of the course (week
                1-2) I'd just grasped the basics of HTML and was starting to learn CSS, so I only understood very
                elementary controls for styling, such as fonts and background colours. In the upcoming pages I'll start
                to use flexbox to improve the layout.</p>

                <h2>My family</h2>
                <p>I live with my wife, Adri, and our 2 kids, Jon & Izzy. We live near Birmingham in the West Midlands,
                    in the same house we bought as our first house in 2007.</p>
                <p>Here's a little about each of them:</p>
                <div>
                    <img src="assets/media/images/a3.jpg" alt="Adri and me">
                    <h3>Adri</h3>
                    <p>Adri is originally from South Africa and works as an Art teacher. She's amazing at her job and
                        has a real passion for her subject. We've been married for 17 years and we met at a Halloween
                        party in
                        2005 (she was Medusa and I was a zombie). She's my best friend and there's no-one I'd rather
                        spend an evening with (splitting a cheeseboard and drinking pinotage).
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img src="assets/media/images/pickle.jpg" alt="Jon and me">
                    <h3>Jon</h3>
                    <p>Jon is 16 (ok, 15, but I figured I'd say 16 as I got his age wrong in the bank recently) and is a
                        pc-gaming fiend. The hours he's put into Fortnite, Rocket League, Roblox, Minecraft and many
                        others, is baffling. He stays up until about 3am every night and struggles to wake up in the
                        morning. My
                        parents are very pleased that he's being exactly as I was at the time. He's a great son though -
                        loving, caring and supportive, clever and talented at whatever he tries (from football to
                        piano).
                    </p>

                <div>

                    <h3>Izzy</h3>
                    <p>Izzy is 13. Actually 13. She's a straight-A student who really cares and does her best at
                        everything she does. She's empathetic and wise beyond her years. She's got a really similar
                        music taste to
                        me and is starting to learn guitar at the same age as I did. It's taken her a while to enjoy
                        playing, but after several months (and lessons <u><i>not</i></u> given by me) she seems to have
                        caught
                        the bug. She's also an amazing singer and aside from singing in the school choir, she
                        contributed
                        harmonies to a song I recorded called "Penny Black". Finally, her super-power is awkwardness.

                    <h3>My wider Family</h3>
                    <p>I'm fortunate that both my parents and my in-laws are still with us. My folks could be in better
                        health, but I still get to see them often and they're close enough so that I can help them out
                        when they need it (well, perhaps not every time they need it, but most times that they ask!). My
                        sister, Abi, is 5 years older than me and lives just the other side of Sutton Park. She's
                        married to
                        Paul and they have 2 kids, Will and Letty. This picture is from Christmas last year when Abi
                        managed
                        to feed the 5,000! Interestingly, Abi (sat at the far end of the table) looks like she's been
                        photoshopped into the picture, when in reality it was me who wasn't actually in the original
                        shot...

                    <h3>The Boys</h3>
                    <p>No, not the TV show, but our 17 month old Cavapoo dogs, Fudge and Rufus. They're crazy, cuddly,
                        loud, soft, lively, pestering, cute and fun. We had 2 dogs, Jack and Kitten, from 2006 until
                        last year, and after they died I wasn't sure I could face having dogs again. The house was so
                        quiet without them though, and Adri (and the kids) convinced me to get these two. They're
                        idiots, but I love them.

            <section>
                <h2>CSS Wrap up</h2>
                <p>I kept the styling light. I chose a different colour background and used coolors to pick other
                    colours which would work with it for use in the nav bar, and on headings. I made some tweaks to
                    fonts, margins, and widths. I also used class, id and element selectors as well combining them for
                    specificity.
                </p>
                <p>On the next page I'll bring in flexbox to improve the layout of the page.
