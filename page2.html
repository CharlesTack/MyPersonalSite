            <p>...now, what do I make it about?</p>
        </header>

            <p>Page 2 is a little more complex than Page 1. It's still just HTML, but I've added a little CSS to make it look a little nicer. I've also added a navigation bar at the top of the page to make it easier to navigate between pages.</p>
            <p>It's still pretty basic, but it's a step up from Page 1. I'm learning more about HTML and CSS every day, and I'm excited to see how my skills develop as I continue to learn.</p>
            <p>Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to build my first web page!</p>
