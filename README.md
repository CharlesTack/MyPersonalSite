# My Personal Site
The one I created in VS and brought over to GitPod/Hub

## I'll update this once I've actually gotten somewhere.
The idea is that the first page is just HTML with no CSS, and as you click through the pages it gradually adds layers of complexity so that:

Page 1 is just plain HTML.
Page 2 is HTML with some simple CSS.
Page 3 adds more complex CSS and responsiveness.
Page 4 uses Bootstrap.
Page 5 is designed for mobile-first.
Page 6 goes for a more modern design.

I can then add more pages as and when I know more (so perhaps JS and Python functionality).

The content will also have a flow through the ideas I have for a personal site, which at the moment would be:

Page 1: contemplating what to have as the subject matter.
Page 2: Introducing my family and dogs.
Page 3: A bit about me, my career history and why I'm doing this.
Page 4: A section on my musical background, and some of the bands I've been in.
Page 5: A section on my guitars (possibly with breakout pages for each brand).
Page 6: a page about Wedge and Baz.
